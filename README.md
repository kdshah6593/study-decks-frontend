# StudyDecks
This is the documentation for the frontend of the StudyDecks web app developed as a JavaScript project for Flatiron School.

The backend repo is available at `https://github.com/kdshah6593/study-decks-backend`

## Description
StudyDecks is a web application developed using JavaScript on the Frontend and Rails as an API as the backend. This web app is intended as a simple study tool for users. A user can have multiple decks and within each deck they can create flashcards and go between them. A user can flip the flashcard over, thus they can quiz themselves.

## Installation
To use this app, check out the deployed version at [StudyDecks](https://study-decks.herokuapp.com/)

To play around with the code of the app, clone these repos:
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/kdshah6593/study-decks-frontend`
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/kdshah6593/study-decks-backend`

## Usage

After cloning, open up 2 terminals and access the directory for each of them in each terminal `$ cd study-decks-frontend` & `$ cd study-decks-backend` (if nested under other directories be sure to include those in the path)

In your terminal running the BACKEND:

Run `$ bundle install` to add dependencies, then run `$ rails db:migrate`, and then start the server `$ rails s`

In your terminal running the FRONTEND:

Run `$ explorer.exe index.html` (for Windows/WSL sytems) or `open index.html` (for Macs); this will open up the frontend page in your default browser
